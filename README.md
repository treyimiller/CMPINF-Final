## Overview:
We will be asserting which Pittsburgh neighborhood is the best and defending it based on WPRDC data. 

## Metrics:
Arrests, firearms, crime, fire incidents, income, housing value

## The tests:
First we will use data of crime rates in the city. Then, we will rank the neighborhoods based on crime.
Then we will compare the neighborhoods based on the arrests in the neighborhoods and rank them.
Then, we compare the firearms seized, and the neighborhood they were seized from. They are then ranked and compared.
Comparing the neighborhood's fire incidents.
Searching for the highest income neighborhoods and ranking them.
Searching for the highest housing values in neighborhoods and ranking them.
